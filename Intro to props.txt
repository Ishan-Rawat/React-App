Many a times in our project we will encounter logic that is used at many places. For example, here in our application we are cycling through a list 
of blogs in the Home component to display the list of blogs. Now, there are many places where we may have to display a similar list of blogs,
for example on the categories page, search page etc.

Now, it is not feasable to write the same logic again and again at all these different places. So what we can do is that we can turn this repeating logic into a component of its own.
We can then insert this component at all the different places this repeating logic appears.

But, what about the data that is supplied to this component. For example we use the blog list component in 3 components: Home page, search page, and categories page.
We wont be supplying the same list to this page that we supllied in the home page, cuz in the categories page we only want the blogs of a specific category,
and on the search page we only want the blogs that contain a certain keyword. Thus we have to supply different data to these components at different places.

This is where PROPS come in. Props allow us to pass data from parent component to child component.
