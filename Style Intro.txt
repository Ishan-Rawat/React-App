After creating the the different components we want to add style to them.
In the src folder we will see that there is a file called App.css You would expect that we can define different styles for each of the components that are applied only to the component they have been defind for.

But that is not the case. When we import App.css in App.js component react just appends that Style to the Head of the DOM. 
So, as a result the CSS in App.css is applied to each and every component that is being displayed to the page.
Same goes for the index.css file we can find in the Src directory.
If we veiw the indexhtml page in the browser and inspect element, we will find 2 style tags in the head element.
One is from index.css and one from app.css.

We can create separate css files for the individual components for the sake of organisational clarity but it wont mean that the style defined for 1 component will only be applied to that component only.

Thus, in this project we will put all the styles in 1 document, i.e., index.css.

It is possible to define styles for individual components that are applied to only specific components (meaning we scope the styles) using:
1. CSS modules
2. Styled components
but right now they are outside our scope.

Read Navbar.js for some notes on inline styles in JSX.
